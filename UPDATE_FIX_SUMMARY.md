# ✅ Update System Improvements

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Previously, if someone typed their name differently:
- "John Smith" first time
- "john smith" second time → Would create **duplicate entries**

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. **Case-Insensitive Matching**
The backend now matches names **case-insensitively**:
- "John Smith" = "john smith" = "JOHN SMITH" = "John smith"
- All treated as the **same person**
- No more duplicates!

### 2. **Update Warning**
Users now see a warning if they already have entries:
```
ℹ️ You already have 5 entry/entries for this week. Submitting will replace them.
```

This shows when they:
- Enter their name
- Already have entries for that week
- System detects existing entries and warns them

---

## 🔄 How Updates Work

### Before Submission:
1. User enters name
2. System checks if entries exist (case-insensitive)
3. If exists: Shows warning "You already have X entries"
4. User knows they're updating, not creating new

### During Submission:
1. Backend finds entries with matching name (case-insensitive)
2. **Deletes old entries** for that week
3. **Inserts new entries**
4. Result: User's week is **updated**, not duplicated

---

## 💡 Key Benefits

- ✅ **No more duplicates** - "John Smith" and "john smith" are the same
- ✅ **Clear warning** - Users know they're updating
- ✅ **Easy to change mind** - Can update location anytime
- ✅ **Works with any capitalization**

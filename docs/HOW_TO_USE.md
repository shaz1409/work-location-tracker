# 🌐 How Your Team Will Use The App

## ✅ For Your Team (40-50 people)

### What They See:
1. **They click the link you share** (your Vercel URL)
2. **Your app opens** - no login, no account, no password
3. **They enter their name**
4. **They fill in their work week**
5. **They click "Save my week"**
6. **Done!**

### Example Flow:
```
John Doe: "What's the work tracker link?"
You: "Here it is: https://your-app.vercel.app"
John: *Opens link*
     *Enters name: "John Doe"*
     *Selects Office/WFH/Client for each day*
     *Clicks "Save my week"*
     *Done!*
```

**That's it!** No Vercel account needed, no login, nothing!

## 🔐 For You (The Admin)

### What You Do in Vercel:
1. **You log into Vercel** (the website builder/admin panel)
2. **You deploy your app**
3. **You share the public URL**
4. **Your team uses it** - they never see Vercel!

### Think of it like:
- **You** = Vercel account owner (builds & deploys)
- **Your team** = Regular website visitors (no account needed)

Just like how you manage a WordPress site, but visitors don't need WordPress accounts!

## 🎯 The Two Different Things:

### 1. **Vercel Dashboard** (for you):
- https://vercel.com/login
- **Only you access this**
- To manage deployments, settings, etc.

### 2. **Your App** (for everyone):
- https://your-app.vercel.app (the URL you share)
- **Everyone with the link can access**
- No login required!

## 💡 Real-World Analogy:

**Vercel** = Your website hosting (like GoDaddy or Bluehost)
**Your App URL** = The public website (like www.example.com)

People don't need a hosting account to visit a website!

---

## 🎊 Bottom Line:

**Share your Vercel app URL** with your team → They use it instantly → **No logins needed!**

Your app is just a regular website that anyone with the link can access.

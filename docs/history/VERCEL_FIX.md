# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Fix

## ✅ I've Fixed the Issue!

The problem was in `vercel.json` - it had extra `cd frontend` commands that caused errors.

**I've:**
1. ✅ Updated `vercel.json` to correct format
2. ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

## 📍 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Update Vercel Settings

1. **In your Vercel dashboard**, go to **Settings** → **General**
2. **Find "Root Directory"** 
3. **Set it to**: `frontend`
4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable (If not done yet)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_BASE`
   - **Value**: `https://work-location-tracker.onrender.com`
   - **Environment**: All (Production, Preview, Development)
3. **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **3 dots** (...) on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. **Or just wait** - Vercel will auto-redeploy from the latest commit

## 🎯 The Root Directory is Critical!

When you set Root Directory to `frontend`, Vercel:
- ✅ Runs commands from within the `frontend` folder
- ✅ Finds `package.json` automatically
- ✅ Builds the Vite app correctly
- ✅ Serves from the `dist` folder

Without this setting, Vercel tries to build from the repo root and fails!

## ⏱️ What Happens Next

- Vercel will pull the latest commit (with the fixed vercel.json)
- It should build successfully now
- You'll get your live URL in 2-3 minutes

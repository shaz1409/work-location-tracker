# 🔓 Fix: People Being Asked to Log In

## ❌ Problem
Your team is being asked to log in when they shouldn't be.

## 🎯 Likely Cause
Vercel has **"Password Protection"** or **"Deployment Protection"** enabled on your project.

---

## ✅ Fix This Now:

### Step 1: Check Vercel Settings
1. **Go to** https://vercel.com
2. **Click on your project** (`v2-work-location-tracker`)
3. **Click "Settings"** tab
4. **Look for these sections:**

### Step 2: Disable Password Protection
1. In **Settings**, look for **"Deployment Protection"** or **"Password Protection"**
2. **Make sure both are OFF:**
   - ✅ **Deployment Protection** = **"Disabled"**
   - ✅ **Password Protection** = **"Disabled"**

### Step 3: Share the Production URL (Not Preview)
Your app has TWO URLs:
- ✅ **Production**: `https://v2-work-location-tracker.vercel.app` (public!)
- ❌ **Preview**: `https://v2-work-location-tracker-git-main-yourname.vercel.app` (may be password protected!)

**Make sure you're sharing the PRODUCTION URL!**

---

## 🔍 How to Find Your Public Production URL:

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard**
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Find the deployment that says **"Production"** (not "Preview")
4. **Copy that URL** - that's the one to share!

---

## 🎯 What to Check Right Now:

1. ✅ **Settings** → **Deployment Protection** → Should be "Disabled"
2. ✅ **Settings** → **Password Protection** → Should be "Disabled"
3. ✅ **Deployments** → Look for **"Production"** deployment
4. ✅ **Share the Production URL**, not any Preview URL

---

## 🧪 Test It Yourself:

1. **Open an incognito/private browser window**
2. **Visit your app URL**
3. **You should see your app directly** - no login screen!

If you still see a login screen in incognito, the protection is still enabled.

## 💡 Alternative: GitHub Organization Protection

If you're in a GitHub organization, Vercel might have auto-enabled protection. To disable:

1. **Settings** → **General**
2. Look for **"Password Protection"**
3. Turn it **OFF**
4. **Save**

---

## 📊 After Disabling Protection:

Your team should be able to:
- ✅ Open the link
- ✅ No login screen
- ✅ Use the app directly
- ✅ Enter their name and save their week

---

## 🎉 Done!

Once protection is disabled, your app is truly public and anyone with the link can use it!

## 💰 Cost: $0/month

- ✅ Render (backend): Free forever
- ✅ Vercel (frontend): Free forever
- ⚠️ Note: Backend may sleep after 15 min inactivity, but wakes up on first request

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### First request is slow?
- Backend is sleeping (free tier), takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- Subsequent requests are instant

### Want it always on?
- Upgrade Render to "Always On" plan: $7/month

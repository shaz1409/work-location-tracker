## ✅ **Your App is Live!**

- Your app will be at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- Share this URL with your team of 40-50 people
- They can access it from anywhere!

---

## 💰 **Cost**

- **$0/month** - 100% free!
- Render free tier: May sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity (wakes up on first request)
- Vercel: Free forever for personal projects

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Backend sleeps?
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake
- Consider upgrading Render to Always On ($7/month) if needed

### Frontend can't connect?
- Check `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable in Vercel
- Make sure backend URL has no trailing slash

### Data resets?
- SQLite on Render is ephemeral (data can reset)
- For production, upgrade to PostgreSQL on Render (free tier available)

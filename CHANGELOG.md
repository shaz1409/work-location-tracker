# 📝 Changes Made

## ✅ Recent Updates

### 1. **Removed Weekends**
- Changed from 7 days (Mon-Sun) to 5 days (Mon-Fri only)
- Backend now calculates week end as Friday instead of Sunday
- Users can now only fill in weekdays

### 2. **Update Logic** (Already Working!)
The backend already handles updates perfectly:
- When someone submits their week again, it **deletes old entries** for that date range
- Then inserts the **new entries**
- This allows people to change their mind and update their locations
- Same person, same dates = update existing entries

### 3. **Improved Dashboard Display**
- **Previous**: Showed each person as a separate card
- **Now**: Shows location badges with people listed inline
- Example display:
  ```
  Monday, January 15, 2024
    [Office] - John, Alice, Bob
    [WFH] - Charlie, David  
    [Client] - Emma (Client Name)
  ```
